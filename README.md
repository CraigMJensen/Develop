## Refactor of an existing page

This project refactors the HTML and CSS pages to make the webpage more accessible for screen-readers and to help with search engine
optimization.

I changed some of the div tags to semantic HTML tags, such as, section, aside, header and footer.  Added alt tags to images.  I also added comments to show where I changed things.

For the CSS, I combined many elements together to simplify the code.  I did find that commas are very important in completing the project.
I missed one comma and spent a long time trying to figure out what was going wrong.  Always double check your commas and quotes.
Also added some comments to the CSS.
